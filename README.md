### Responsive Layout

This application is just for display only, no functionality.  I used CCS variables so try to optimize the code. I used CSS grid 
for the site's layout.  I added media queries to make the page mobile responsive.  I added font awesome for the icons on the page, and google fonts for the text throughout the page.
